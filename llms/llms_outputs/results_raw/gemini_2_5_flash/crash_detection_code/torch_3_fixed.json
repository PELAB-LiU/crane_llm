    "reasoning": "The `CustomModelMultichoice` expects `labels` to be a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_choices)` where each element is a 0 or 1 indicating the correct choice. However, the `target` tensor is `[[1, 0, 1]]`, which has a shape of `(1, 3)`. Inside the model's forward pass, `labels = torch.argmax(labels, dim=1)` will be applied to `target`, resulting in `torch.argmax([[1, 0, 1]], dim=1)` which gives `[0]`. This will cause a dimension mismatch when `loss_func(logits, labels)` is called, as `logits` will have shape `(1, 3)` and `labels` will have shape `(1,)`. `NLLLoss` expects `labels` to be a 1D tensor of class indices, but the `logits` shape is `(batch_size * num_choices, num_choices)` or `(batch_size, num_choices)` after `logits.view(-1, self.num_choice)`. Given `logits` is `(1, 3)` and `labels` is `(1,)`, `NLLLoss` will expect `logits` to be `(1, C)` where `C` is the number of classes, and `labels` to be `(1,)` containing class indices. This setup is correct for `NLLLoss` if `logits` represents log-probabilities. However, the `sigmoid` is applied to `outputs.logits` before `NLLLoss`, which means `logits` are probabilities, not log-probabilities. `NLLLoss` expects log-probabilities. This will lead to incorrect loss calculation and potentially a crash if the values are not in the expected range for log-probabilities.",

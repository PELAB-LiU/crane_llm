When `sns.barplot` is called, it expects numerical data for the x-axis, but `train_agg[...,1]` and `valid_agg[...,1]` are converted to `int` which is correct. However, `y=train_agg[...,0]` and `y=valid_agg[...,0]` are arrays of strings (the class names), which is also valid for the y-axis in a bar plot. The `order=CLASSES` argument ensures the correct ordering of the bars. Therefore, no crash is expected.",

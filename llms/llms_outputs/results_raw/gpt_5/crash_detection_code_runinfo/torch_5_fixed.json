More likely, data loaders depend on images_path; absence of dataset could have failed earlier, but executed cells succeeded. testBatch prints batch_size items, which may exceed actual batch length and can index out of range if last batch smaller. However, DataLoader for testing_set_loader has shuffle=False and batch_size=128; if dataset size isn’t multiple of 128, last batch smaller, causing IndexError. Not certain dataset size not multiple, so cannot be sure.",

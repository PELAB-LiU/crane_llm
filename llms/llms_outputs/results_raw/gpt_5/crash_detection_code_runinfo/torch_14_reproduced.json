However, Faster R-CNN expects images as tensors and targets as dicts per item, not batched by default; using DataLoader with batch_size=4 and default collate_fn will try to stack dicts and tensors and cause a collate error. Also model with pretrained=True may require internet. Not certain environment specifics.",

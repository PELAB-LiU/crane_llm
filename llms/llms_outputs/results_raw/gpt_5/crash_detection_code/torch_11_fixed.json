But earlier, in train loop, cy appears to be already batch tensor; however in previous DataLoader for elmotrain, __getitem__ returns (_x.long(), _y.long()) where _y is a 2D one-hot over vocab, but not used here. Here using st_train provides labels as ints, so shapes align. The likely crash: torch.manual_seed incorrectly set (not used), but not affecting. Biggest issue: model.forward returns probs, loss uses mse with one-hot: works. Therefore not certain to crash.",
